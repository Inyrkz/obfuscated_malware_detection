# obfuscated_malware_detection
Designing an ML system to detect malware using computer memory data.

## Introduction
The malware memory analysis dataset is from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC). The malware memory analysis dataset contains data about obfuscated malware. Malware that is obfuscated hides to evade discovery and destruction. The goal of this dataset is to evaluate memory-based obfuscated malware detection techniques. In other words, can we detect obfuscated malware using memory data? There are two classes represented in the dataset: benign and malicious. The malicious records consist of Spyware, Ransomware and Trojan malware. There are 58596 entries and 57 variables in the dataset. The dataset can be downloaded [here.](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/malmem-2022.html)

The `malware_detection.ipynb` jupyter notebook contains the project implementation. The `report.docx` file gives a comprehensive report of the project.

The `Obfuscated-MalMem2022.csv` file is the original dataset. The `Cleaned_Obfuscated-MalMem2022.csv` file is the dataset used for analysis after cleaning. While the `CleanedDataBeforeTraining.csv` file is the dataset used for training the machine learning algorithms after data pre-processing.
